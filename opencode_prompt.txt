BACKEND STARTUP FAILURE - Immediate Fix Required

The backend server failed to start due to a critical error. You need to fix this NOW.

## Error Type: Backend unhealthy or critical errors present

## Backend Error Output (stderr):
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated superagent@8.1.2: Please upgrade to superagent v10.2.2+, see release notes at https://github.com/forwardemail/superagent/releases/tag/v10.2.2 - maintenance is supported by Forward Email @ https://forwardemail.net
npm warn deprecated supertest@6.3.4: Please upgrade to supertest v7.1.3+, see release notes at https://github.com/forwardemail/supertest/releases/tag/v7.1.3 - maintenance is supported by Forward Email @ https://forwardemail.net

## Working Directory: /app/vitereact

## Your Task:
1. **Analyze the Error**: Identify the exact TypeScript/JavaScript syntax error or compilation issue
2. **Locate the Problem**: Find which file has the error (check stack trace and error messages)
3. **Apply the Fix**: Use available tools to fix the specific syntax/compilation issue
4. **Focus on Root Cause**: Fix the underlying code problem, not infrastructure

IMPORTANT: This is a CODE error, not an infrastructure error. Fix the syntax/compilation issue in the backend code.
